        INTRO_H : 'Introduction',
        INTRO_P1:'What is luxury? Is it a barefoot stroll across a reclaimed wood veranda to a private cove? A hot-air-balloon ride at sunrise to panoramic views of rolling vineyards? Or an exquisite Vintage Cuvée Champagne, paired with a beautifully executed progression of dinner courses? Perhaps a private jet to the most discreet of destination resorts?',
        INTRO_P2:'It is all these things, and yet luxury is also personal, inimitably so. It is the courage to turn from the usual to the unusual, from the conventional to the rarefied.',
        INTRO_P3:'With this in mind, explore the superlatives of Thailand’s luxury offerings, where private beaches, hot-air-balloons, Champagne and helicopter experiences (and much, much more) are not simply offered, but served to the utmost perfection, forever surpassing expectations.',

        HOME_BANGKOK_H : 'Bangkok City of Angels',

        HOME_BANGKOK_D1_P1 : 'Energising, charismatic and often as complex as ornate Thai script, Bangkok has as many different personalities as it does options for sumptuous food. ',
        HOME_BANGKOK_D1_P2 : 'There’s the hyper modern party animal; a place where days and evening spent in glitzy malls and restaurants graduate to risqué adult entertainment and pulsing nightclubs that keep bodies moving until dawn. ',
        HOME_BANGKOK_D1_P3 : 'Meanwhile, a mellower, more spiritual side, characterised by elaborate temples and palaces, canals and arty, alternative culture counterbalance these brasher aspects of the city. ',
        HOME_BANGKOK_D1_P4 : 'In Thailand all roads lead to Bangkok. The capital is the nation’s political centre, its spiritual and cultural hub, and a magnet for migrants from all over the country. Thais do a fine job of balancing the spiritual with the earthly. ',
        HOME_BANGKOK_D1_P5 : 'The Kingdom is 95 percent Buddhist, and Bangkok is blessed with hundreds of temples from humble pagodas to grand, gold-spired complexes. ',
        HOME_BANGKOK_D1_P6 : 'Just as strong as these religious beliefs is the Thai emphasis on sanuk, the idea that life should be fun. Although deadly serious when the occasion demands it, Thais tend to be very playful at work and in their day-to-day dealings ',
        HOME_BANGKOK_D1_P7 : 'Bangkok is widely known and admired for the contrasts it offers travellers. It is also catering increasingly adeptly to the well-heeled.  ',
        HOME_BANGKOK_D1_P8 : 'The roads in exclusive areas such as Thonglor and Ekkamai are clogged with the Ferraris and Lamborghinis of the Thai high society as they shuttle between new cutting-edge restaurants and clubs.',

        HOME_BANGKOK_D2_P1 : 'This proliferation of luxury is not confined to the traditional stomping grounds of the Thai elite either. From the commercial districts of Silom and Sukhumvit Road to the old city and the banks of the Chao Phraya River, luxury hotels, gastro-bars and other upscale haunts such as whisky and cigar bars and designer barbers are springing up with the regularity of a ticking metronome. ',
        HOME_BANGKOK_D2_P2 : 'From ultra-accomplished ventures by some of the world’s top chains to unique – and in many cases intricate – boutique boltholes, Bangkok’s selection of luxury hotels is one of Asia’s healthiest. Many of the big names are congregated in the commercial hubs of Sukhumvit and Silom. These areas are ideal for their proximity to the thick of the action, but many visitors prefer to be located near the Chao Phraya River for a more relaxed stay.',
        HOME_BANGKOK_D2_P3 : 'Although it remains (justifiably) most famous for its mind-blowing street food culture – something that unites both the haves and have-nots – Bangkok has emerged as an increasingly prestigious destination for upscale dining. In fact, according to the most recent list of the top 50 restaurants in Asia compiled by San Pellegrino, the continent’s top dining spot is currently Gaggan, where Calcutta-born chef Gaggan Anand flirts with molecular gastronomy to produce acclaimed Indian cuisine.',
        HOME_BANGKOK_D2_P4 : 'Bangkok’s reputation as a nightlife playground is richly deserved. Nevertheless, there’s more refinement and subtlety to the scene than lurid tales of neon-lit fleshpots would have you believe.',

        HOME_BANGKOK_D3_P1 : 'Although it was a small trading post as recently as the 15th century, Bangkok has been at the heart of Thailand’s modernisation. The city, therefore, is littered with important landmarks, both regal and spiritual. The iconic sights are mostly concentrated near the Chao Phraya River where you will find the Grand Palace and Dusit Palace as well as famous temples such as Wat Pho, home to the world’s largest reclining Buddha, and Wat Phra Kaew, the most sacred temple in Thailand.',
        HOME_BANGKOK_D3_P2 : 'Muay Thai (Thai boxing) may be the country’s national sport, but shopping is undoubtedly Thailand’s national pastime. For variety and value, Bangkok is far and away the best retail experience in Southeast Asia. Sleek megamalls boast high-end designers, international brands and a smattering of breakthrough Thai labels. For local character, meanwhile, Chatuchak Weekend Market and Talat Rot Fai offer thousands of stalls and just as many opportunities to empty your wallet.',
        HOME_BANGKOK_D3_P3 : 'Although famously fast-paced, there’s a gentler, more relaxed side to the city. Leafy neighbourhoods such as Banglamphu and Ari shelter arty cafés and hip music venues while a boat on the Chao Phraya River is a fine vantage point from which to observe the city in all its glory. In fact, few Bangkok experiences are more inspiring than witnessing one of the city’s legendary sunsets from a river boat or from one of the many classy venues that continue to sprout up along the banks of the royal waterway. ',
        HOME_BANGKOK_D3_P4 : 'It is hot, frenetic, and sometimes overwhelming, but one thing the Thai capital can never pretend to be is boring. ',

        
        HOME_NORTHERN_H : 'Northern Thailand Lanna Charms',

        HOME_NORTHERN_D1_P1 : 'In a country of high-profile tourist attractions and destinations, northern Thailand is sometimes neglected. Yet while paradisiacal beaches and sumptuous coastal resorts might be absent, this part of the Kingdom is as rich in luxury appeal as any. ',
        HOME_NORTHERN_D1_P2 : 'Most visitors base themselves in Chiang Mai – Thailand’s cultural capital and second-most populous city after Bangkok. The city’s appealing situation in the cradle of emerald mountains and its easy balance of tradition and modernity make it a fine place to strike out from.',
        HOME_NORTHERN_D1_P3 : 'However, the region has plenty more strings to its bow. Forested mountains, vibrant rice paddies and rushing rivers imbue it with a bucolic, almost Edenic feel while towns and villages such as Pai, Mae Hong Son and Chiang Rai abound with hill-tribe culture and easy-going, laidback vibes.',
        HOME_NORTHERN_D1_P4 : 'For the vast majority of visitors, Chiang Mai is the perfect gateway from which to explore northern Thailand. Although it is Thailand’s second city, Chiang Mai couldn’t be further removed from Bangkok. Nestled in the foothills of northern Thailand, the city is replete with hundreds of sacred temples, many of which date back to its days as the capital of the ancient Kingdom of Lanna.',
        HOME_NORTHERN_D1_P5 : 'These holy relics, as well as the city’s quaint moated old quarter and its location amidst prime visual splendour, make Chiang Mai a special place to be.',
        HOME_NORTHERN_D1_P6 : 'As steeped in tradition as Chiang Mai is, it is far from a city that is defined purely by its history. Upmarket hotels, bars and restaurants are appearing like clockwork while shopping options run the gamut from left-field independent boutiques and a famous Night Market. ',

        HOME_NORTHERN_D2_P1 : 'Away from the historic centre, it is very much a dynamic and modern place. Areas such as Nimmanhaemin thrum with creative energy as the movers and shakers of the city carve out contemporary art and music venues amid the concrete shophouses.',
        HOME_NORTHERN_D2_P2 : 'Leisure options also abound. Some of the Kingdom’s finest golf courses are located near the city. Meanwhile, activities such as rock climbing and zip-lining bolster Chiang Mai’s claim to be one of Thailand’s preeminent bases for adventure activities.',
        HOME_NORTHERN_D2_P3 : 'Yet, despite its contemporary trappings, Chiang Mai remains a sanctuary. Its magical qualities hit a spellbinding zenith in the range of ultra-deluxe accommodations on offer. From sumptuous boutique hideaways that evoke the old-world elegance of the Orient to extravagant resorts that incorporate picturesque rice paddies, tropical hardwoods and traditional Lanna architecture, the city and its environs boast some of Thailand’s most affecting retreats.',
        HOME_NORTHERN_D2_P4 : 'Leisure options also abound. Some of the Kingdom’s finest golf courses are located near the city. Meanwhile, activities such as rock climbing and zip-lining bolster Chiang Mai’s claim to be one of Thailand’s preeminent bases for adventure activities.',

',

        HOME_NORTHERN_D3_P1 : 'Despite Chiang Mai’s centrality, the north of Thailand is far from a one-city show. The first true Thai kingdoms rose in this part of the country, and northerners are fiercely proud of their local customs and heritage. The north is also home to most of the country’s ethnic tribes, with Karen, Shan and Yunnanese among those who have made their homes in remote mountain valleys.',

The north is also home to most of the country’s ethnic tribes, with Karen, Shan and Yunnanese among those who have made their homes in remote mountain valleys.',
        HOME_NORTHERN_D3_P3 : 'Significantly smaller than Chiang Mai, yet still blessed with alluring restaurants and hotels along with a wide range of activities and leisure options, Chiang Rai is winning favour as an alternative base in the region. Thailand’s northern-most city, Chiang Rai is located in the famous Golden Triangle, the confluence of Thailand, Laos and Myanmar. An area of remarkable physical beauty, this part of Thailand also offers visitors the opportunity to partake in a wealth of unforgettable outdoor activities with trips to superbly run elephant camps among the many highlights.',
        HOME_NORTHERN_D3_P4 : 'Whether it is Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai or one of its lesser-known provinces, Thailand’s uppermost reaches offer endless possibilities.',

 
        HOME_PHUKET_H : 'Phuket The Pearl of the Andaman',

        HOME_PHUKET_D1_P1 : 'Thailand’s biggest island, Phuket is long established as one of the jewels in the Kingdom’s tourism crown. Famed the world over for its white-sand beaches, fabulous resorts and buzzing nightlife, the destination remains as attractive as ever to those seeking a healthy dose of pure indulgence.',
        HOME_PHUKET_D1_P2 : 'One of the most precious things about the island is its endlessly multi-faceted character. Yes, there are resorts and beaches to die for, but this is far more than a mere holiday paradise; it is a living and breathing island with its own history, character and traditions.',
        HOME_PHUKET_D1_P3 : 'Phuket’s strategic location has attracted traders from around the globe and the island has absorbed influences from Europe, Arabia and China. These cultural quirks may not be immediately apparent to those who choose to sequester themselves in their resort. However, the island’s rich melange of shaping factors asserts itself in everything from its strong Muslim heritage to its distinctive architecture and acclaimed cuisine.',
        HOME_PHUKET_D1_P4 : 'A large portion of what makes Phuket so distinct can be attributed to its sheer size. Although surrounded by the Andaman Sea on all sides, the island’s healthy dimensions mean that it is often hard to believe that you are cut off from the mainland. Yet, while this accessibility brings with it multi-lane highways and other big city attributes such as shopping malls, the extra space means that it is easy enough to find respite from the crowds wherever you are.',
        HOME_PHUKET_D1_P5 : 'For those in search of a lively kind of vacation, Phuket’s more commercial beaches are equipped with everything from classy restaurants to stunning beach clubs. Of these options, Patong, Kata and Karon are the most famous and all are blessed with plentiful luxurious resorts and other facilities. Away from the more commercial areas, the island boasts several quieter – yet still very well-serviced – enclaves such as Surin, Rawai and Kamala beaches. Elsewhere, Phuket has several of the country’s best resorts, many with their own spotlessly white private beach sloping gently down towards the crystalline water of the Andaman Sea.',

        HOME_PHUKET_D2_P1 : 'Less famous than the main island but often equally attractive are the islands that pepper the ocean near Phuket. Located in stunning Phang Nga Bay, the twin islands of Koh Yao Yai and Koh Yao Noi are two of Thailand’s most underrated with some fantastic beaches and resorts as well as a laidback and friendly Muslim culture.',
        HOME_PHUKET_D2_P2 : 'As Thailand’s most popular holiday island it is no surprise that Phuket is particularly blessed with first-class golf courses. Red Mountain Club, The Lakes course at Blue Canyon and Phuket Country Club have garnered plaudits both for the standard of golf and the stunning scenery on offer, and quality is equally high elsewhere on the island.',
        HOME_PHUKET_D2_P3 : 'Diving is another undoubted highlight of a visit to Phuket. Day trips from Phuket to diving hotspots such as Phi Phi and the Racha Islands operate throughout the year. A little further afield, but certainly worth making the extra effort for, are the world-class scuba sites at the Similan and Surin Islands in the Andaman Sea.',
        HOME_PHUKET_D2_P4 : 'Located a reasonable distance from Phuket off the shores of Phang Nga Province, these pristine outcrops are best experienced via a liveaboard dive cruise. Guests don’t have to venture too far from Phuket itself to experience the wonders of the Andaman Sea. Activities such as stand-up paddle-boarding, windsurfing and kayaking are growing in popularity while Phuket is famously home to the King’s Cup Regatta, Thailand’s most prestigious sailing event.',
        HOME_PHUKET_D2_P5 : 'As you might expect from a destination so experienced at catering to the needs of a global visitor base, one of Phuket’s specialties is its culinary scene. Here you’ll find everything from classic and contemporary fine dining to some of Thailand’s most delicious seafood restaurants. Special mention must be made of the dining scene in Phuket Town. The island’s capital is not the most obvious tourist destination, but it is well worth visiting for its unique – often Chinese-influenced – cuisine. ',

        HOME_PHUKET_D3_P1 : 'Indeed, the dining scene in Phuket Town is indicative of a different – less commercial – side to Phuket that is often overlooked by visitors.  Known as the “Pearl of the Andaman”, the island’s beautiful interior shelters gibbon rehabilitation projects as well as fruit orchards, towering waterfalls and rubber tree plantations.',
        HOME_PHUKET_D3_P2 : 'Phuket Town, meanwhile, is one of Thailand’s most compelling provincial towns with a beguiling blend of cultural influences. Other highlights for visitors include zip-lining, cooking schools and colourful Chinese temples.',
        HOME_PHUKET_D3_P3 : 'For the majority of visitors, however, it is Phuket’s dazzling beaches and crystalline waters that earn top billing.  As the daylight hours fade and the sun sinks towards the Andaman Sea, many visitors head towards Promthep Cape in the island’s south to catch the last rays of the day. Alternatively, the island’s many stunning beach bars are the perfect place to propose a toast to the end of another day in paradise.',


        HOME_SAMUI_H : 'Koh Samui & Krabi Welcome to Paradise',

        HOME_SAMUI_D1_P1 : 'Few things encapsulate Thailand’s abundance of natural riches better than the country’s paradisiacal coastal enclaves. The Kingdom is uniquely blessed with countless amazing islands, while its extensive coastlines on the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea are studded with dazzling stretches of sand and buzzing beach towns. ',
        HOME_SAMUI_D1_P2 : 'Two of the shining stars in the Kingdom’s firmament of vacation havens are Koh Samui and Krabi. Both are highly distinctive from one another. Koh Samui luxuriates in its location in the Gulf of Thailand and specialises in upscale hedonism. ',
        HOME_SAMUI_D1_P3 : 'Krabi Province, meanwhile, is one of the undoubted highlights of Thailand’s Andaman coastline, encompassing stunning limestone karst scenery, beautiful resorts and sought-after island destinations such as Koh Phi Phi and Koh Lanta.',
        HOME_SAMUI_D1_P4 : 'It wouldn’t be pushing it to call Koh Samui the grande dame of Thailand’s tourism industry, having been in the business longer than almost any other Thai island. Familiarity, however, has not dulled the charms of this perennial crowd pleaser. In fact, the island has matured as a destination and has diversified its products to ensure it stays ahead of the game.',
        HOME_SAMUI_D1_P5 : 'Foreign visitors started trickling into Samui in the 1960s and for years the island was most popular as a destination for hippy travellers and independent backpackers. In those days, paved roads were non-existent and accommodation and dining on the island were limited to basic wooden beach huts and simple Thai cuisine.',
        HOME_SAMUI_D1_P6 : 'These days, the island is infinitely more high-end. While echoes of the old rustic Samui can be found in the less developed south and west of the island, the emphasis elsewhere is very much on the finer things in life.',


        HOME_SAMUI_D2_P1 : 'Some of Thailand’s most decadent resorts can be found here. Think gorgeous infinity pools surrounded by giant day beds where guests are waited on hand and foot by immaculately turned out waiting staff and you’d be on the money. Many of these resorts are villa-only, ensuring the ultimate in privacy as well as panoramic views out towards the cystal-clear waters of the ocean.',
        HOME_SAMUI_D2_P2 : 'In addition to these palatial, yet contemporary comforts, many of the island’s top resorts boast sleek bars and beach clubs where a beautiful crowd can be found soaking up mellow beats in the fresh sea breeze.',
        HOME_SAMUI_D2_P3 : 'Another area in which Samui has been excelling in recent times is its dining sector. The island is now a culinary destination in its own right with several world-class restaurants helmed by innovative chefs. Here visitors will find everything from contemporary Thai cuisine to fusion and international flavors.',
        HOME_SAMUI_D2_P4 : 'Enhancing the experience even further is the variety of romantic dining locales. Fancy feasting on succulent fresh seafood with powder soft sand between your toes, or being waited on by a butler at a cliff-top table? Samui is the perfect place for it.',
        HOME_SAMUI_D2_P5 : 'Like Samui, Krabi is finding favour with a jet-setting, high-income bracket group from Asia and further afield. Although blessed with similarly stunning stretches of sand and other tropical finery, the landscapes of Krabi Province and its many paradise islands vary significantly from those on Koh Samui.',
        HOME_SAMUI_D2_P6 : 'Its limestone-karst scenery particularly characterises the area, with perpendicular rocky outcrops jutting from the emerald waters of Phang Nga Bay and curving along the coast.',

        HOME_SAMUI_D3_P1 : 'As well as being stunningly attractive, this geological phenomenon has made Krabi Province a particular favorite with adventure sports fanatics. In fact, Railay Beach near Krabi Town is regarded by many experts as the best place for rock-climbing in Asia and has a wide range of routes to suit every skill level. In addition to climbing, the land and seascapes of the area offer scope for everything from caving to kayaking amidst the karsts and through tiny rock channels to hidden lagoons. Diving is also a specialty of the area with colourful marine life lying in wait underneath the waves at dive sites around the province.',
        HOME_SAMUI_D3_P2 : 'Of course, exertion is not for everyone and when the scenery is this good it pays to kick back and just enjoy a slower pace of life. In common with Thailand’s other coastal destinations, Krabi Province is not short on unforgettable places to stay with some of the Kingdom’s best and most exclusive resorts to be found here. Take a boat to a secluded hideaway in its own private bay or revel in the ultimate in barefoot luxury.',
        HOME_SAMUI_D3_P3 : 'Krabi’s luminous beauty arguably reaches its zenith at Koh Phi Phi. This archipelago of six small islands is renowned globally for its outstanding beaches and fabulous scenery. The blockbuster movie The Beach was filmed on the island of Phi Phi Leh but islands such as Phi Phi Don are just as glamorous with azure waters, craggy cliffs and verdant jungle providing a heart-stoppingly attractive palette for the ultimate beach break.',



        HOTEL_H : 'Hotels & Resorts Rest Your Head in Style',
        HOTEL_P1 : 'The Land of a Tousand Smiles welcomes visitors with famed and gracious service at a host of five-star hotels and resorts countrywide, where guests are lapped up in luxury. From modern, state-of-the-art city stays to exotic mountain and coastal resort retreats where your every whim and need is catered for, hospitality in Thailand is an art re ned to perfection.',

        HOTEL_NORTHERN_H : 'Northern Thailand',

        HOTEL_NORTHERN_FSR_H : 'Four Seasons Tented Camp Chiang Rai',
        HOTEL_NORTHERN_FSR_P1 : 'The Golden Triangle – the name given to the area where Thailand, Burma and Laos meet – is a legendarily beautiful corner of Southeast Asia. And this luxury camp, which is backed by jungle patrolled by majestic elephants, captures the essence of the area perfectly. Indeed, elephants are central to the camp’s appeal, with  guests being offered unique opportunities to get up close with Thailand’s gentle giants. The camp’s tents, meanwhile, are situated high in the treetops and boast open-plan spaces and large outdoor decks with hot tubs. ',

        HOTEL_NORTHERN_DC_H : 'Dhara Dhevi Chiang Mai',
        HOTEL_NORTHERN_DC_P1 : 'History abounds in Thailand’s northern capital. Therefore it is fitting that one of the city’s most exclusive resorts exudes heritage appeal. Although it has only been open for a decade or so, the property has a timeless quality with luxury villas located in a rural setting next to green rice paddies and surrounded by peaceful local communities. The spacious suites and villas showcase a fusion of Thai and colonial architectural styles and feature elegant teak wood fittings. The centrepiece is the spa, a 3,100-square-metre sanctuary embellished with ornate moldings and sculptures.',

        HOTEL_NORTHERN_FSM_H : 'Four Seasons Resort Chiang Mai',
        HOTEL_NORTHERN_FSM_P1 : 'Located in the Mae Rim Valley around an hour’s drive from Chiang Mai, this property is the epitome of a luxurious sanctuary. Surrounded by mountains and verdant rice fields, the resort capitalises on its glorious surroundings. Sumptuous bungalows are decked out with original paintings and valuable Thai art, and feature expansive outdoor living spaces. The resort’s swimming pool is a beauty and is particularly attractive at night when the stars and light from lanterns reflect upon its placid surface. Other leisure services include yoga classes, biking and specialist treatments in the lavish spa.',

        HOTEL_NORTHERN_137_H : '137 Pillars House, Chiang Mai',
        HOTEL_NORTHERN_137_P1 : 'There’s nothing like an interesting backstory to add lustre to a hotel, and 137 Pillars is not short on historic colour. The property, located in Chiang Mai’s arty Wat Gate district, dates back to 1889 and was once owned by Louis Leonowens, the son of Anna (of Anna and the King movie fame). The refurbished building is now a serene home-away-from-home with a blend of traditional Thai architecture and sleek modern design. The garden is dotted with day beds while the spacious rooms come with trimmings such as espresso machines and private butler service. ',

        HOTEL_NORTHERN_RCM_H : 'Rachamankha, Chiang Mai',
        HOTEL_NORTHERN_RCM_P1 : 'Few visitors remain unmoved by Chiang Mai’s spiritual qualities. And the city’s rich Buddhist heritage is to the fore at this resort, which is located right next door to Wat Phra Singh, arguably the most famous temple in the northern capital. Four other notable temples are within easy walking distance, but guest may prefer to meditate on the tranquil features of the hotel itself. Designed by Thai architect Ong-ard Staranbhandhu, the property is laid out to incorporate myriad hidden courtyards and gardens. Beautiful antiques judiciously adorn rooms and suites, while an open-air massage pavilion is the perfect place to ease aching bones.',

        HOTEL_NORTHERN_ACM_H : 'Anantara Chiang Mai',
        HOTEL_NORTHERN_ACM_P1 : 'One of Chiang Mai’s most appealing features is the Mae Ping River and the waterside location is a major draw here. Nestled between a towering wall and the peaceful river, the resort is a true sanctuary that offers both glorious seclusion as well as a convenient launch pad pad for forays out to nearby sights. The property’s lavish suites and guest rooms are sumptuously appointed and all boast private balconies. Other highlights, meanwhile, include cruises on the river, a 34-metre outdoor pool and the resort’s famed afternoon tea.',

        HOTEL_CENTER_TSB_P1 : 'No expense was spared in the creation of e Siam – and it shows. Built at a cost of around US$32 million, this sumptuous hotel is de nitely one of a kind. Conceived by Thai actor and rock star Krissada Sukosol, it is unmistakably one of the most unique boltholes in Bangkok. With assistance from famed American architect Bill Bensley, Sukosol used the 39-room property as a repository for his mammoth collection of antiques and collectibles. Highlights include the 11 pool villas, which have private gardens, secluded roof terraces and oversized bathrooms with 3.2-square-metre hand-fnished terrazzo bathtubs.',

        HOTEL_CENTER_MOB_H : 'Mandarin Oriental Bankok',
        HOTEL_CENTER_MOB_P1 : 'Agrande dame of the Asian hotel scene, this opulent riverside fixture oozes comfort and class.

        HOTEL_CENTER_TSB_H : 'The Sukhothai Bangkok',
        HOTEL_CENTER_TSB_P1 : 'Nestled in the heart of the Thai capital is The Sukhothai Bangkok. Though it’s on the doorstep of the city, it is set far back, beyond greenery and a long driveway, from the hustle and bustle of the CBD’s Sathorn Road. Its guarantee of privacy has drawn celebrities and notable figures to the five-star hotel, though it is the fine dining, particularly at Italian eatery La Scala, and wellness centre Spa Botanica, that keeps them coming back time after time.

Three- and four-day itineraries have been devised around elephants – from learning some basic mahout (elephant rider) skills, feeding and caring for the animals, to going trekking through lush forests and witnessing elephants’ favourite part of the day: washing (and playing) in the river. Many of these elephants have been saved from the streets of cities like Bangkok and Pattaya where they were brutally exploited, and it’s a touching experience to see them so happy back where they belong.',
