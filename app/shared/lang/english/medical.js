        MEDECAL_P2 : 'Travelling abroad for medical services can be one of the most intimidating decisions a person makes. Whether it’s life-saving surgery or cosmetic reconstruction, safety and comfort are always paramount when travelling abroad.',
        MEDECAL_P3 : 'Time and time again, affluent travellers looking for medical services have chosen Thailand over other destinations because of its stateof-the-art facilities and legendary hospitality.

In 2015, overseas patients are expected to inject more than US$3 billion into Thailand’s economy.',
        MEDECAL_P4 : 'The Joint Commission International (JCI), a United States-based governing body that accredits hospitals worldwide, has recognised 36 Thailand hospitals for their quality care, far more than any other country in Southeast Asia. This means that waiting for more than a week for an appointment in Bangkok is almost unheard of. A broad range of doctors, specialists and subspecialists are available for consultations around the clock. The majority of these specialists receive their medical certifications abroad, but Thailand also has its own outstanding training programs.',

Nothing could be better for a speedy recovery than sunshine and a getaway on a drop-dead gorgeous beach. Once discharged, many patients run away to the islands, and indulge in wellness spas and resorts tucked behind the folds of nature. Massage treatments and aromatherapy using local herbs can effortlessly ease the mind, while nutritious Thai cuisine, fresh juices and organic fruits and vegetables all do their part to help the body rebuild.',
        MEDECAL_P9 : 'To make life easier, there are companies that help facilitate patients’ journeys, tackling everything from the plane ride to a luxury-laden recovery. These health tourism providers work as intermediaries with hospitals and other organisations to provide a complete experience for their clients.
