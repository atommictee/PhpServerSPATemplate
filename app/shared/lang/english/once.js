        ONCE_CPD_P1 : 'Putting Bangkok’s dizzying concrete offerings aside, the flowing Chao Phraya River, the heart of the Kingdom, is the perfect place to enjoy an authentic Thai feast. The Apsara Dinner Cruise (www.banyantree.com/en/ap-thailand-bangkok/apsara) barge glides serenely along the river as Thailand’s royal cuisine (requiring far more preparation and attention to detail than the usual staid pad thai) is served up, allowing visitors to observe local life along the country’s most important waterway.',

        ONCE_HOE_P1 : 'Being a guest at the Four Seasons Tented Camp Golden Triangle (www.fourseasons.com/goldentriangle) means an opportunity to engage with Thailand’s gentle giants in their natural habitat in the most personal way possible. Three- and four-day itineraries have been devised around elephants – from learning some basic mahout (elephant rider) skills, feeding and caring for the animals, to going trekking through lush forests and witnessing elephants’ favourite part of the day: washing (and playing) in the river. Many of these elephants have been saved from the streets of cities like Bangkok and Pattaya where they were brutally exploited, and it’s a touching experience to see them so happy back where they belong.',
